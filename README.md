# On-Time-Performance-Stats
This is a semester-long project for my Probability & Statistics for Computer Science course.

It uses descriptive statistics and data visualizations to analyse the on time performance of New Jersey Transit
commuter rail between 2018 and 2020. 

This project was a fun way to learn both Python and probability & statistcs. If I had enough time (or managed my time better) I would have liked to explore using this data set with weather data, and then possibly geographic or GTFS data. I did start to explore probabilities a few commits back but that section was unfinished (and possibly incorrect) so that was omitted in the final submission. That would have been something else interesting to explore.

This data set was chosen because I've always been interested in transportation and regional planning. Data like this would be great for predicting future delays, scheduling, and using it alongside other datasets (i.e. weather data like the author suggests). The author scraped data from NJT's DepartureVision realtime status service. I have my own project using SEPTA's real time data and this might inspire me to create something similar.
