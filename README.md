# On-Time-Performance-Stats
This is a semester-long project for Probability & Statistics for Computer Science

It uses descriptive statistics and data visualizations to analyse the on time performance of New Jersey Transit
commuter rail between 2018 and 2020. 

This project was a fun way to learn both Python and probability/statistcs.
